##### _A PAC Coach Management System_

The Personal Academic Coach (PAC) management system is an application that allows our (fictional) client, PACE academy, to assign a PAC to students at the academy easily. This application also allows a student to login and check their assigned PAC and allows a PAC to login and check all students assigned to them along with their details.

## Our Solution
Our solution is to create a web application that connects to an external database. This application will allow students to view their PAC, PACs to view their students, and an admin to assign PACs to students, along with a functional login system for students and PACs.
