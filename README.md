##### _A PAC Coach Management System_

The Personal Academic Coach (PAC) management system is an application that allows our (fictional) client, PACE academy, to assign a PAC to students at the academy easily. This application also allows a student to login and check their assigned PAC and allows a PAC to login and check all students assigned to them along with their details.
